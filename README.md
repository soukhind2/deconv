The fMRI deconvolution toolbox is a Python package that has been developed on top of the fMRIsim module of BrainIAK. provide some additional information that will permit cognitive neuroscience researchers to develop optimal designs for many common experimental designs used in fMRI.  

Currently, the toolbox only supports two conditions that are alternating in a sequence such as A-B-A-B-A-B... where A and B represent a cue and a target respectively, similiar to attention related fMRI designs (Hopfinger 2000, Kastner 1999).

A future release will include support for multiple stimuli in a trial similar to a event related trial by trial fMRI design.

This toolbox implements the methods proposed in paper:
